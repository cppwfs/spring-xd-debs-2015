\section{Introduction}

The era of Big Data has introduced many new technologies for data storage
and processing. The success and high demand for horizontally scalable
solutions such as HDFS, Spark, and Kafka demonstrates this need. At the
same time, enterprises have invested heavily in older and proven
technologies such as SQL databases and messaging systems. For enterprises
to adopt the emerging technologies, there must be a way to easily
connect with existing systems.

Expanding upon the success of existing technologies in the Spring portfolio
such as Spring Integration and Spring Batch, Spring XD provides a runtime
environment that integrates with a plethora of technologies, both established
and up-and-coming.

Creating a stream in Spring XD is a simple concept for those familiar with
UNIX streams and pipes. Consider the following shell command:

\verb;tail -f /tmp/log.txt | grep ERROR;

The tail command will continuously display the file. The |
will pipe the output of tail to grep, which will filter out all
lines that do not contain the string ERROR.

The equivalent using Spring XD looks like this:

\verb;stream create -name error-filter -definition;\\*
\verb;  "tail -name=/tmp/log.txt | filter;\\*
\verb;  --expression=payload.contains('ERROR') | log";

While this specific example will only tail a local file, an ingestion stream
that aggregates, filters, and stores log file analytics can just as easily
be created with Spring XD.
