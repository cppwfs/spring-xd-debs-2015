\section{Introduction}

The era of Big Data has introduced many new technologies for data storage
and processing. The success and high demand for horizontally scalable
solutions such as HDFS, Spark, and Kafka demonstrates this need. At the
same time, enterprises have invested heavily in older and proven
technologies such as SQL databases and messaging systems. For enterprises
to adopt the emerging technologies, there must be a way to easily
connect with existing systems.

Since its inception in 2004, the main objective of the Spring Framework
has been to simplify application development. At the time, Java developers
were struggling with EJBs, boilerplate JDBC, and JMS. Today's developers
are dealing with an explosion of data and the leading-edge tools to
manage and process this data.

Expanding upon the success of existing technologies in the Spring portfolio
such as Spring Integration and Spring Batch, Spring XD provides a runtime
environment that integrates with a plethora of technologies, both established
and up-and-coming.

Although enterprise system integration is one of the strengths of Spring XD,
it is a compelling technology for brand new applications that have streaming
or batch data processing requirements. Spring XD features a built in
interactive shell for creating streams or jobs without writing any Java code.
This allows for quick development cycles and easy experimentation.

Creating a stream in Spring XD is a simple concept for those familiar with
UNIX streams and pipes. Consider the following shell command:

\verb;tail -f /tmp/log.txt | grep ERROR;

The tail command will continuously display the file contents. The |
will pipe the output of tail to grep, which will filter out all
lines that do not contain the string ERROR.

The equivalent using Spring XD looks like this:

\verb;stream create -name error-filter -definition;\\*
\verb;  "tail -name=/tmp/log.txt | filter;\\*
\verb;  --expression=payload.contains('ERROR') | log";

While this specific example will only tail a local file, a distributed 
ingestion stream that aggregates, filters, and stores log file analytics
can just as easily be created with Spring XD.
