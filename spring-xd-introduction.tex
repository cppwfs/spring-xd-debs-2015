\section{Introduction}

Here is the Spring XD introduction. We'll talk about the UNIX philosophy, pipes, filters, and so on.

Consider the following shell command:

\texttt{tail -f /tmp/log.txt | grep ERROR}

The tail command will continuously display the file. The | will pipe the output of tail to grep, which will filter out all lines that do not contain the string ERROR.

The equivalent using Spring XD looks like this:

\texttt{stream create --name error-filter --definition "tail --name=/tmp/log.txt | filter --expression=payload.contains('ERROR') | log" --deploy}
